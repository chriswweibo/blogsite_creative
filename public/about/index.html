<p>Director of big data product and analysis, Genowis, 3, 2017-present**</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Genowis is a fast-paced startup company dedicated to the synergy between genotype and phenotype data from the top-tier hospitals in China. Under the collaboration with the China Anti-cancer Society and other professional organizations, it holds the biggest pathological textual database in the world (among reported ). Its commercial partners and customers include Illumina, BGI, Roche, Astra Zeneca, Jinyu, Huayin etc.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mainly in charge of the data science projects life cycle including requirements gathering, data preprocessing, NLP, data analysis, database construction, data security and product development. Almost everything I contributed is pioneering and from scratch.</p>
<ul>
<li>Designed and implemented the explainable hybrid architecture, R_SQUARED_PIPE, for the product-grade textual information extraction job, with deep learning models (biLSTM, BERT), statistical learning models (tf-idf, CRF, word embedding) and knowledge graph. Constructed the supporting tools such as the annotation platform, domain-specific validation tool and quality control dashboard. Overall F1 score 99%+.</li>
<li>Lead and implemented many data science projects, such as
<ul>
<li>using Local Outliers Factor (LOF) to detect suspicious medical reports, meanwhile avoiding mis-shooting the rare medical cases, followed by t-SNE dimensional reduction.</li>
<li>constructing the knowledge graph about diseases, drugs and bio-markers, with 2300 nodes and 21000 relations. Upon the KG,  we did some graph learning work, and compared popular graph embedding algorithms, such as Deepwalk, LINE, Node2vec and TADW,  to support downstream clustering, patient recommendation and testing program recommendation.</li>
<li>Other experimental data science projects: semantically nested NER, logical structure learning, temporal-constrained patient trajectory profiling, MVI prediction in liver cancer using XGboost, OCR powered information extraction and interpretation for medical reports, horizontal federated learning for multi-site data privacy protection, prognosis prediction by explainable machine learning, saying Shapley Value.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Co-authored one international peer-reviewed journal article (IF=5.1) as an AI expert in the liver cancer project.</li>
<li>Constructed the first professional  P(athological)IMS data platform suite: EIR (trade-marked), mEIR and CEDAR, in China. 10+ top-tier hospitals have used EIR for daily operation. And CEDAR has served more than 100 hospitals for information extraction, saving 80% of traditional manual precessing time.</li>
<li>Obtained the first million-dollar-level data science order for the company.</li>
<li>Managed around 17 staffs, including algorithm engineers, PMs, developing engineers, analysts, medical managers and interns.</li>
<li>Some recruiting, branding and road showing tasks.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Algorithm Specialist, Opera China, 12, 2016-3, 2017</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Opera is the renowned browser company in Norway, sharing 300 million users approximately in the world, especially in Europe, Africa and Southeastern Asia.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Responsible for the user profiling for the news recommender system via log mining, including the geo-location calculation, gender predication and interest labels generation for each individual on a daily basis, mainly using database ETL, logistic regression model and textual mining. Optimized the geo-location calculation by complying with the GDPR (&lsquo;General Data Protection Regulation&rsquo;) in Europe.</p>
<p><strong>Algorithm Specialist, Youku, Alibaba, 6, 2014-11, 2016</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Youku Alibaba is a top-3 video platform in China, analogous to the combination of YouTube and Netflix. It has billions of page visits per day, with the greatest contribution from the Chinese community.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Responsible for the algorithm improvement for the video search engine (Soku) by off-line monitoring and anti-click-bait. With user&rsquo;s click data and machine learning algorithm, detected the latent deficiency of the searching results, such as the freshness of the videos, the diversity of video types. Constructed the click-bait detection system mainly by the random forest model using video textual info and users' click-view behavior data.</p>
<p><strong>Software Engineer, CAPE, Aviation Industry Corporation of China, 7, 2013-6, 2014</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>CAPE is a governmental research organization focusing on the software and hardware quality in the aircrafts. Software reliability authorization in CAPE is an indispensable part of airworthiness for many models of China made aircrafts.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Responsible for the software requirements modeling and failure modes analysis/prediction by  the Apriori algorithm using inspection log.</p>
